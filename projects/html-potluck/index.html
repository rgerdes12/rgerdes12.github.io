            <li>2 heads garlic</li>
            <li>Extra-virgin olive oil, for drizzling</li>
            <li>Kosher salt and freshly ground pepper</li>

        <br>
        <h3>Directions:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Make the crab cakes: Heat the vegetable oil in a large
                skillet over medium heat. Add the shallot, celery and 
                bell pepper; cook until just tender, 3 to 4 minutes. Stir
                in the panko, 1 teaspoon Old Bay, 1/4 teaspoon salt and 1/2
                teaspoon pepper; cook until the panko is lightly golden, 2
                to 3 minutes. Transfer to a large bowl and let cool.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                Add the crabmeat, beaten egg, Donkey Sauce, chives, basil
                and the remaining 1 teaspoon Old Bay to the bowl. Fold 
                together until well combined, breaking up some of the crab.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                Preheat the oven to 425°. Line 2 baking sheets with 
                parchment paper. Using a 1-ounce scoop, mound balls 
                of thecrab mixture (18 to 20 balls) on the baking sheets,
                2 inches apart; flatten them slightly. 
                Refrigerate 10 minutes.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                Bake, rotating the pans halfway through, until the crab
                cakes are golden brown and cooked through,
                15 to 18 minutes.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                Meanwhile, make the sauce: Combine the Donkey Sauce,
                lemon juice, chives, basil and Old Bay in a medium bowl
                and stir. Serve the crab cakes with the sauce and lemon
                wedges.
            </li>
        </ol>
        <h4>Donkey Sauce:</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Preheat the oven to 350°. Slice off approximately 1 inch
                of the pointed top of each garlic head so that the cloves
                are slightly exposed. Place the heads on a sheet of foil
                and drizzle with olive oil. Season with salt and pepper.
                Tightly wrap the garlic in the foil. Place on a rimmed 
                baking sheet and roast until the garlic is very tender 
                and soft, 35 to 40 minutes.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                Squeeze out 1/4 cup of the roasted garlic cloves
                (reserve the rest for another use). Mash thoroughly.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                Combine the mashed garlic with the mayonnaise,
                mustard, Worcestershire sauce, 1/4 teaspoon salt and
                pepper to taste in a medium bowl. Mix thoroughly. 
                Refrigerate until ready to use.
            </li>

        <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
        <br>
        <ul>
            <li>Kosher salt</li>
            <li>12 ounces linguine</li>
            <li>1 1/4 pounds large shrimp, peeled and deveined</li>
            <li>1/3 cup extra-virgin olive oil</li>
            <li>5 cloves garlic, minced</li>
            <li>1/4 to 1/2 teaspoon red pepper flakes</li>
            <li>1/3 cup dry white wine</li>
            <li>Juice of 1/2 lemon, plus wedges for serving</li>
            <li>4 tablespoons unsalted butter, cut into pieces</li>
            <li>1/4 cup finely chopped fresh parsley</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <h3>Directions:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add the
                linguine and cook as the label directs. Reserve 1 cup
                cooking water, then drain.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                Meanwhile, season the shrimp with salt. Heat the olive
                oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add the
                garlic and red pepper flakes and cook until the garlic
                is just golden, 30 seconds to 1 minute. Add the shrimp
                and cook, stirring occasionally, until pink and just
                cooked through, 1 to 2 minutes per side. Remove the shrimp
                to a plate. Add the wine and lemon juice to the skillet
                and simmer until slightly reduced, 2 minutes.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                Return the shrimp and any juices from the plate to the
                skillet along with the linguine, butter and 1/2 cup of
                the reserved cooking water. Continue to cook, tossing,
                until the butter is melted and the shrimp is hot, about
                2 minutes, adding more of the reserved cooking water as
                needed. Season with salt; stir in the parsley. Serve with
                lemon wedges.

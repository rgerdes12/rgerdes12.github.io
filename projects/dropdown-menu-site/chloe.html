                <h1> Meet Chloe</h1>
                <p>
                    Chloe is an energetic ball of energy! She loves kids and 
                    other pets and would make a great pet for someone looking 
                    to add another member to their family. Her favorite thing 
                    to do is take naps while cuddling on the sofa. Her favorite 
                    treat is puppy cookies. She is four years old and has all 
                    of her shots and is in perfect health!

                <h1>Final Fantasy XIV</h1>
                <p>
                    Final Fantasy XIV[c] is a massively multiplayer online 
                    role-playing game (MMORPG) developed and published by 
                    Square Enix. Directed and produced by Naoki Yoshida and 
                    released worldwide for PlayStation 3 and Windows in August 
                    2013, it replaced the failed 2010 version, with subsequent 
                    support for PlayStation 4, macOS, PlayStation 5, and Xbox 
                    Series X/S. Final Fantasy XIV is set in the fantasy region 
                    of Eorzea, five years after the devastating Seventh Umbral 
                    Calamity which ended the original version. In the Calamity, 
                    the elder primal Bahamut escaped from his prison, an ancient 
                    space station called Dalamud, unleashing an apocalypse 
                    across Eorzea. Through temporal magic, the player character 
                    of the original version escaped, reappearing at the start of
                    A Realm Reborn. As Eorzea cements its recovery, the player 
                    must fend off a reignited invasion from the Garlean Empire.

                    The original Final Fantasy XIV was a commercial and critical
                    failure. Then-Square Enix President Yoichi Wada announced 
                    that a new team, led by Yoshida, would assume control and 
                    address the game's flaws. The new team both continued to 
                    develop and improve the original version, and secretly 
                    worked on a completely new replacement. This new game, 
                    codenamed "Version 2.0", used a new engine, improved server 
                    infrastructure, and revamped gameplay, interface, and story.
                    The original version shut down in November 2012, followed 
                    by an alpha test for Version 2.0.

                <h3>Gameplay</h3>
                <p>
                    Final Fantasy XIV is an MMORPG, featuring a persistent world
                    where players can interact with each other and the 
                    environment. Players create and customize their characters 
                    for use in the game, including name, race, gender, facial 
                    features, and starting class. Unlike in the original 
                    release, players may only choose to be a Disciple of War or 
                    Magic as a starting class—Disciples of the Hand and Land are
                    initially unavailable.[2] Players must also select a game 
                    server for each character. While all supported languages are
                    available on every server, data centers are located in 
                    specific regions (i.e., North America, Europe, Japan, and 
                    Oceania) to reduce latency between client and server, and 
                    players are advised to choose a server in their region.[3] 
                    Regardless of server or language, players can use a large 
                    library of automatically translated game terms and general 
                    phrases, allowing players who speak different languages to 
                    communicate.[4]

                <h3>Plot</h3>
                <p>
                    PC and home console versions use a unified user interface 
                    (UI) and control scheme allowing for any combination of 
                    keyboard, mouse, and game controller. On PC, the game 
                    defaults to drag and drop menus, whereas on the console 
                    versions, the default interface resembles the PlayStation 
                    3's XrossMediaBar.[5] This bar is used to access menus, 
                    maps, logs, and configuration options. The head-up display 
                    for both versions includes a message log, party status menu,
                    mini-map, and action bar. The size and location of all UI 
                    elements may be customized.[6]

                <h3>Development</h3>
                <p>
                    Players improve their characters by gaining experience 
                    points (EXP) and acquiring stronger equipment. After gaining 
                    enough XP, the character will "level up", improving their 
                    statistics, enhancing the character's performance, and often 
                    learning new actions. Primary sources of experience points 
                    in Final Fantasy XIV include completing quests, exploring 
                    instanced dungeons, participating in Full Active Time Events 
                    (FATEs), and slaying monsters in the world.[7] Quests, 
                    including the "main scenario" questline, are generally 
                    short, specific tasks given to the player by non-player 
                    characters which reward items and EXP. Completing main 
                    scenario quests progresses the overarching plot of the game. 
                    Some quests are repeatable, either "daily" quests repeatable 
                    each day, or "Levequests", which consume "leve allowances" 
                    that the player slowly accrues over time. Dungeons often 
                    require multiple players to form a party to enter, but the 
                    Duty Support system enables the player to play certain 
                    dungeons alone, supported by computer-controlled party 
                    members. Some dungeons are for lower-leveled players to gain 
                    EXP quickly while others are for experienced players to 
                    collect rare items, equipment, and currency.[8] The Duty 
                    Roulette system randomly assigns the player to an accessible 
                    dungeon, and once per day, awards additional bonus EXP 
                    scaled to character level on completion.[9] FATEs permit 
                    large groups of players, whether or not they are in a party, 
                    to participate in a shared task in the world. These 
                    location-specific events include battles with notorious 
                    monsters, defending locations, escorting non-player 
                    characters, culling wildlife, and assaulting enemy 
                    fortresses, among other types.[8] Finally, each enemy the 
                    player kills provides EXP, with further EXP available from 
                    the Hunting Log, for killing a fixed amount of specific 
                    creatures. At maximum level, character progression focuses 
                    entirely on acquiring stronger equipment, raising the 
                    character's "item level". This equipment can be gained 
                    through a variety of sources including endgame dungeons, 
                    crafting, raids, primal battles, and elite mark hunts.[10]

                <h3>Reception</h3>
                <p>
                    In contrast to the original version, Final Fantasy XIV has 
                    earned a generally positive reception and robust sales 
                    numbers. Prior to release, both the game's press and fans 
                    were surprised by its quality and level of polish. IGN's 
                    Charles Onyett cited many specific improvements over aspects
                    of the initial game and recognized that "it seems like 
                    Square's doing the right things to fix the many mistakes 
                    made with Final Fantasy XIV's original design".[142] 
                    Following an impressive showing at Gamescom 2012, it won 
                    Destructoid's Gamescom Community Choice Award. The editorial 
                    staff observed "the considerable changes made to the engine, 
                    HUD and combat system, transforming it into a far cry from 
                    the game that disappointed so many".[143] However, 
                    GameSpot's Jonathan Toyad was less confident about the game, 
                    praising the changes but commenting that many features would 
                    seem overly familiar to players of modern MMORPGs.[144]
